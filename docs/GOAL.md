# Codimir â€“ Product Goals

## Purpose

Codimir exists to make manual and automated software testing easy, collaborative, and organized for engineering teams. It aims to provide:

- **A fast, modern alternative to TestRail** with better UX and lower barrier to entry.
- **Documentation-first approach** so every test case is clear, actionable, and linked to product knowledge.
- **Team-focused workflows:** Simple role management, easy sharing, and transparency.

## Non-Goals

- Codimir is **not** aiming to be a full ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) tool.
- No direct automation runner integration in the MVP (automation integrations may come post-MVP).
- Not targeting legacy, on-prem-only installations (optimized for cloud/serverless).

## Core Values

- Simplicity, transparency, and developer happiness.
- Open-source, extensible, and easy to self-host.
